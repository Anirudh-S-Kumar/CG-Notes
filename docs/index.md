# Computer Graphics

Notes I make while taking the course of Computer Graphics. The course is taught by [Prof. Ojaswa Sharma](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~ojaswa/). It's advised to use these as a reference/revision instead of learning from them(although you can do that). Some images that were present in lecture slides were not able to be added, and notes regarding referring to the lecture slides for illustrations is added 

## My personal review of the course

If you are even mildly interested in this topic, then this course will scratch that itch that you have. The course is very well structured, and the professor is fantastic at explaining the concepts and addressing doubts.
