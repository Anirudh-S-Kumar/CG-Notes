# What is Financial Analysis?

Financial analysis is the process of evaluating businesses, projects, budgets, and other finance-related transactions to determine their performance and suitability. Typically, financial analysis is used to analyze whether an entity is stable, solvent, liquid, or profitable enough to warrant a monetary investment. 

## Types of Financial Analysis

### Vertical Analysis

Involves looking at various components of 

- The income statement and dividing them by the total revenue to get a percentage
- The balance sheet and dividing them by the total assets to get a percentage

These numbers should be compared to the industry average to see how well the company is doing. Also called common-size analysis.

??? Example
    If the company's income statements looks as following:-

    | | |
    | --- | --- |
    | Total Revenue | 100 |
    | Cost of Revenue | 60 |
    | Gross Profit | 40 |
    | Operating Expenses | 10 |
    | Operating Income | 30 |
    | Taxes | 10 |
    | Net Income | 20 |

    Then vertical analysis would look like:-

    | | |
    | --- | --- |
    | Gross Profit Margin | 40% |
    | Operating Income Margin | 30% |
    | Net Income Margin | 20% |

### Horizontal Analysis

Involves comparing financial data over a number of years to identify trends. Helps identifying if the company is growing or shrinking. Also called trend analysis. Typically done over minimum of 3 years.

??? Example

    | Income Statement | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Total Revenue | 100 | 120 | 150 |
    | Cost of Revenue | 60 | 70 | 80 |
    | Gross Profit | 40 | 50 | 70 |
    | Operating Expenses | 10 | 15 | 20 |
    | Operating Income | 30 | 35 | 50 |
    | Taxes | 10 | 12 | 15 |
    | Net Income | 20 | 23 | 35 |

    Then horizontal analysis would look like:-

    | Ratio | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Gross Profit Margin | 40% | 41.67% | 46.67% |
    | Operating Income Margin | 30% | 29.17% | 33.33% |
    | Net Income Margin | 20% | 19.17% | 23.33% |
