Financial statements are record of financial activities of a business.

- Current Assets: Used within a year
    - Cash, Inventory, Accounts Receivable
- Non-current Assets: Used for more than a year
    - Land, Building, Equipment
- Current Liabilities: Due within a year
    - Accounts Payable, Short-term Loans
- Non-current Liabilities: Due after a year
    - Long-term Loans, Bonds 
- Shareholder's Equity: Assets - Liabilities
    - Common Stock, Retained Earnings


!!! Important
    Balance sheet should always be balanced. Assets = Liabilities + Shareholder's Equity

??? Question "Which one was Debit and Which one was Credit?"
    - Debit: Left side of the account (when you get money)
    - Credit: Right side of the account (when you pay money)

### Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable

If we were to use credit to buy inventory at 60, and sell it at 90, the balance sheet would look like this:

<div class="grid" markdown>

| Assets  <img width=300/> | |
| ------ | - |
| Cash  | 47 |
| Inventory | 0 |
| Accounts Receivable | 90 |
| Equipment | 80 |
| ^^Total Assets^^ | 217 |

| Liabilities  <img width=300/> | |
| ------ | - |
| Current Liabilities   | 60 |
| Non-current Liabilities   | 50 |
| Shareholders'Equity   | 100 |
| Revenue | 90 |
| Cost of Sales | (60) |
| Salary | (20) |
| Interest | (3) |
| ^^Total Liabilities^^ | 217 |

??? Question "Another Example"
    - Issues shares of 300
    - Bought equipment for 200
    - Bought inventory for 100, 80 of this was cash, remainder is outstanding
    - Sold 75% of inventory for 120, 100 has been received in cash
    - Paid cash expense of 15
    
    What would the balance sheet look like?

    - Issued shares of 300
    
    <div class="grid" markdown>

    | Assets  <img width=300/> | |
    | ------ | - |
    | Cash  | 300 |

    | Liabilities  <img width=300/> | |
    | ------ | - |
    | Shareholders'Equity   | 300 |
    | ^^Total Liabilities^^ | 300 |

    </div>

    - Bought equipment for 200
    
    <div class="grid" markdown>

    | ^^Total Assets^^ | 300 |

    | Liabilities  <img width=300/> | |

## Income Statement

Income statement is a record of financial activities of a business over a period of time.

- Revenue: Money earned from selling goods or services
- Direct Costs: Costs directly related to producing goods or services
- Indirect Costs: Costs not directly related to producing goods or services
- Gross Profit: Revenue - Direct Costs
- Operating Profit: Gross Profit - Indirect Costs
- Net Profit: Operating Profit - Tax and Interest

### Some other terms

- Accrued Expenses : Expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid (office supplies of 2000 were used but will pe paid next year)
- Prepayment : Payment made in advance (1 year insurance, but paid in monthly installments)
- Depreciation : Reduction in value of an asset over time 

## Cash Flow Statement

- Cash from Operating Activities: Cash generated from day-to-day operations

!!! Example 

    ABC. Inc. buys a truck for $45,000 will use it in the business for 5 years, and in 5 years expects to sell it for 
    $15,000

    - Balance Sheet - Assets : 39,000
    - Income Statement - Depreciation : 6,000
    - Cash Flow Statement - Investing Activities : 45,000

### Calculating operating cash flow - direct method

Operating cash inflow - Operating cash outflow = Net operating cash flow

This method is rarely used

### Calculating operating cash flow - indirect method

| | |
| - | - |
| Net Income | A |
| Depreciation | B |
| (Increase)/Decrease in Receivable | (C)/C |
| (Increase)/Decrease in Inventory | (D)/D |
| Increase/(Decrease) in Payable | E/(E) |
| Net Operating Cash Flow | X |


??? Example

    - Cash Purchases: 250
    - Cash Sales: 370
    - Cash expenses: 40
    - Depreciation: 55

    | Income Statement | |
    | - | - |
    | Revenue | 370 |
    |Purchases | (250) |
    | Expenses | (40) |
    | Depreciation | (55) |
    | Net Income | 25 |

    | Cash flow direct | |
    | - | - |
    | Cash Sales | 370 |
    | Cash Purchases | (250) |
    | Cash Expenses | (40) |
    | Net Operating Cash Flow | 80 |

    | Cash flow indirect | |
    | - | - |
    | Net Income | 25 |
    | Depreciation | 55 |
    | Increase in Receivable | 80   |

??? Example

    - Cash Purchases: 280
    - Cash sales: 300
    - Sales on Credit: 170
    - Cash expenses: 50
    - Receipts on receivables: 140
    - Depreciation: 55

    | Income Statement | | 
    | - | - |
    | Revenue | 300 + 170 |
    | Purchases | (280) | 
    | Expenses | (50) |
    | Depreciation | (55) |
    | Net income | 85 |

    | Cash flow direct | | 
    | - | - |
    | Revenue | 300 + 140 |
    | Purchases | (280) |
    | Expenses | (50) |
    | Change in cash | 110 |
    

    | Cash flow indirect | |
    | - | - |
    | Net income | 85 |
    | Depreciation | 55 |
    | Increase in AC Receivables | 140 - 170 |
    | Change in cash | 110 |

??? Example

    - Cash purchases: 150
    - Cash sales: 320
    - Sales on credit : 310
    - Purchases on credit: 180
    - Receipts from receivables: 260
    - Payments to payables: 140
    - Cash expenses: 70
    - Depreciation: 55

    | Income Statement | |
    | - | - |
    | Sales | 320 + 310 |
    | Purchases | (150 + 180) |
    | Expenses | (70) |
    | Depreciation | (55) |
    | Net income | 175 |

    | Cash flow direct | | 
    | - | - |
    | Inflow | 320 + 260 |
    | Purchases | (150 + 140)
    | Expenses | (70) |
    | Change in cash | 220 |

    | Cash flow indirect | |
    | - | - |
    | Net income | 175 |
    | Depreciation | 55 |
    | Account Receivables | (310 - 260 = 50) | 
    | Account Payables | 180 - 140 = 40 |
    | Change in cash | 220 |

### Deriving complete cash flow statement

It's possible to derive cash flow statements using 

- Last year's balance sheet
- This year's balance sheet
- This year's income statement

#### Stage one - Compare the balance sheets

- If assets have increased => cash outflow
- If liabilities have increased => cash inflow. 

#### Stage two - classifying the cash flow

Classify each of the cash flow statements into the following :-

- Operating cash flows
- Investing cash flows
- Financial cash flows

The cash flow we have looked at so far is operating cash flows

Difference in PP&E is occurred due to

- Depreciation lowering PP&E
- Net capital expenditure (a.k.a. CAPEX) increase PPE


$$ \text{Opening PP&E} + \text{Net CAPEX} - \text{Depreciation} = \text{Closing PP&E} $$

Difference in retained earnings is due to

- Net income (added)
- Dividends (subtracted)

## Some Important Quantities

| Quantity | Formula |
| - | - |
| Gross Profit | Revenue - Cost of Sales |
| Operating Profit | Gross Profit - Operating Expenses |
| Net Profit | Operating Profit - Tax |
| Operating Cash Flow | Net Income + Depreciation |
| Net Cash Flow | Operating Cash Flow + Investing Cash Flow + Financing Cash Flow |
| Free Cash Flow | $EBIT(1 - Tax) + \text{Depreciation} - \text{CAPEX} -  \Delta \text{Net Working Capital}$ |
| Net working capital | Current Assets - (Current Liabilities - Notes Payable) |
