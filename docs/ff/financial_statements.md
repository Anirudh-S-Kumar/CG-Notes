| ------ | - |
| Cash  | 47 |
| Inventory | 0 |
| Accounts Receivable | 90 |
| Equipment | 80 |
| ^^Total Assets^^ | 217 |

| Liabilities  <img width=300/> | |
| ------ | - |
| Current Liabilities   | 60 |
| Non-current Liabilities   | 50 |
| Shareholders'Equity   | 100 |
| Revenue | 90 |
| Cost of Sales | (60) |
| Salary | (20) |
| Interest | (3) |
| ^^Total Liabilities^^ | 217 |
