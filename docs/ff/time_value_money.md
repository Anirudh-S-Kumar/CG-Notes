# Time Value of Money
The main idea is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. This is because you can invest that dollar today and have more than a dollar tomorrow. This is the concept of the time value of money. This has the following affects

- *Spending* - You can buy more with 1000 Rs today than 1000 Rs a year from now.
- *Investing* - You can invest 1000 Rs today and have more than 1000 Rs a year from now.
- *Borrowing* - You borrow money today and pay back more than you borrowed.

Reasons for the time value of money are:

- *Inflation* - The value of money decreases over time.
- *Uncertainty* - Money today is more certain than money tomorrow.

## Compounding

$$FV = PV(1 + \frac{i}{n})^{n * t}$$

Where:

- $FV$ = Future Value
- $PV$ = Present Value (Principal): The larger the principal, the greater the returns.
- $i$ = Interest Rate: The higher the interest rate, the greater the returns.
- $n$ = Number of compounding periods per year: The more compounding periods, the greater the returns.
- $t$ = Number of years: The longer the time, the greater the returns.

### Continuously Compounded Interest

$$FV = PV  e^{i * t}$$

### Interest Factor

$$FVIF = (1 + i)^t$$

$$PVIF = \frac{1}{(1 + i)^t}$$

!!! note
    - Rule of 72: To find out how long it takes to double your money, divide 72 by the interest rate.
